# Simple Implementation

## Overview
Basic coding skills - implement utility functions and simple logic

**Difficulty**: 1/5 ⭐  
**Estimated Time**: 15-20 minutes  
**Skills Required**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Basic algorithms, Function implementation

## Your Mission 🎯

You need to implement several utility functions that are commonly used in web applications. The initial code has function stubs and TODO comments - your job is to make them work correctly.

**Key Challenge**: Write clean, efficient implementations that handle edge cases properly.

## Folder Structure
```
01-simple-implementation/
├── initial/          # Your starting point
├── solution/         # Reference implementation (don't peek! 😉)
├── tests/           # Validation tests
├── TASK.md          # This file
└── README.md        # Detailed instructions
```

## Success Criteria ✅

- [ ] All utility functions work correctly
- [ ] Edge cases are handled (null, undefined, empty arrays, etc.)
- [ ] Code is clean and well-commented
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Performance is reasonable for the use case

## Getting Started

1. **Explore the initial code**: Look at `initial/` to understand the starting point
2. **Read the detailed requirements**: Check `README.md` for specific instructions
3. **Implement your solution**: Modify/add files in `initial/` directory
4. **Test your work**: Run `npm test` to validate your implementation
5. **Check against reference**: Compare with `solution/` when done

## Evaluation Focus 🔍

This test evaluates your ability to:
- **Follow instructions** accurately
- **Implement clean, working code**
- **Handle edge cases** appropriately
- **Write maintainable solutions**

## Time Management ⏰

- **Quick scan**: 2-3 minutes to understand requirements
- **Implementation**: 10-16 minutes coding
- **Testing & refinement**: 3-5 minutes validation

Good luck! 🚀
