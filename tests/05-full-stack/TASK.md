## Getting Started

1. **Explore the initial code**: Look at `initial/` to understand the starting point
2. **Read the detailed requirements**: Check `README.md` for specific instructions
3. **Implement your solution**: Modify/add files in `initial/` directory
4. **Test your work**: Run `npm test` to validate your implementation
5. **Check against reference**: Compare with `solution/` when done

## Evaluation Focus 🔍

This test evaluates your ability to:
- **Follow instructions** accurately
- **Implement clean, working code**
- **Handle edge cases** appropriately
- **Write maintainable solutions**

## Time Management ⏰

- **Quick scan**: 2-3 minutes to understand requirements
- **Implementation**: 42-60 minutes coding
- **Testing & refinement**: 3-5 minutes validation

Good luck! 🚀
