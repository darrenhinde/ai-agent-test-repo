# API Integration

## Overview
Backend integration - connect to APIs and handle data

**Difficulty**: 3/5 ⭐  
**Estimated Time**: 30-40 minutes  
**Skills Required**: REST APIs, Data fetching, Error handling, State management

## Your Mission 🎯

Build functionality that fetches data from external APIs, processes it, and handles various scenarios like loading states and errors.

**Key Challenge**: Robust error handling and smooth user experience during data operations.

├── TASK.md          # This file
└── README.md        # Detailed instructions
```

## Success Criteria ✅

- [ ] Successfully fetches data from provided APIs
- [ ] Loading states are handled gracefully
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled appropriately
- [ ] Data is processed and displayed correctly
- [ ] Code follows async/await best practices

## Getting Started

1. **Explore the initial code**: Look at `initial/` to understand the starting point
2. **Read the detailed requirements**: Check `README.md` for specific instructions
3. **Implement your solution**: Modify/add files in `initial/` directory
4. **Test your work**: Run `npm test` to validate your implementation
5. **Check against reference**: Compare with `solution/` when done

## Evaluation Focus 🔍

This test evaluates your ability to:
- **Follow instructions** accurately
- **Implement clean, working code**
- **Handle edge cases** appropriately
- **Write maintainable solutions**

## Time Management ⏰

- **Quick scan**: 2-3 minutes to understand requirements
- **Implementation**: 21-32 minutes coding
- **Testing & refinement**: 3-5 minutes validation

Good luck! 🚀
